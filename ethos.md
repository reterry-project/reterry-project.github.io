Always use our mascot [plane](/favicon.ico) when making logos.

### 1. Freeware vs Commercial
Only freeware assets shall be distributed with the decompilation.

All commercial programs (ones that were actively sold at the beginning of the project)<br>
are strictly prohibited from having assets distributed with the decompilation/rewrite.

### 2. Keep it private without the authors permission
If the owner of the respective content says no, you can't publicly post the source code.

### 3. Don't look back
This isn't actually a rule, I just wanted to name a rule after one of my favourite games!
